        This code below is to demonstrate how to do a Start button that only appears for the Host player
        showStartButton is a local bool that's needed because OnRoomServerPlayersReady is only fired when
        all players are ready, but if a player cancels their ready state there's no callback to set it back to false
        Therefore, allPlayersReady is used in combination with showStartButton to show/hide the Start button correctly.
        Setting showStartButton false when the button is pressed hides it in the game scene since NetworkRoomManager
        is set as DontDestroyOnLoad = true.
